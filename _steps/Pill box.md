Inspired by my grandfather, who constantly forgets taking his pills. Created 5 designs and chose 1 that I am most satisfied with. Creating these CAD was not that hard, but I did find it hard to make something elder friendly. The photo shown is the design that my grandfather finds the most usable, and he still struggles inserting the sliders. I am still working on making it more usable & integrating an alarm into it.
Some how the main user of this product became one of my classmates that need to take antiallergic pills, instead of my grandfater... He found it useful because it separates each day into time slots, and he often forgets when to take his pills

Photo shown is the bottom part of my product. the whole design is in a spherical shape
