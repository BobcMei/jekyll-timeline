Water-air amphibious drone. This was a really complicated project, and I contributed to parts that I am capable doing: I desigend the load unit and adjusted the PID parameters - the electronics and code for the cross domain functions is too complicated for me. 

But I did learn alot from this experience. My teammates and I went to a company in qingdao to test the balance of our first model(as shown in the photo) and got some really cool insights on making a trans-domain vehicles.I learned the method of changing cetner of gravity with minimun space and allowed weight - to switch the position of the battery with a stepper motor. Through this function, the drone can switch its orientation between horizontal and vertical.

Talking witht the employees of the company, I learned about the team dynamics in a engineering team, like how system engineers integrate people in different areas. I also learned from the technicians on how industrial production works, as well as some fundementals in dron designing, like PWM waves.
