The purpose of this product was to prevent our RC from drifting during turns. Designed with onshape and simscale, printed venturi tunnel with nylon carbon fiber. The original chasis was 樱花, with no space for a venturi tunnel, so we redesigned all the electronic placements and reprinted a baseplate. The steering system was also redesigned to make space for the tunnel. Though the product was around 1s slower than the original car, its turning performance was improved, with less drifting during turns. 
This is probably the project that have effected me the most in my high school years. At the start of the project, I could only do basic jobs like arragning bolt placements on the baseplate. But as I learned CAD knowledge from frcdesign.com(very useful website from frc), I understood how CAD works in an engineering context. I then used the skill to redesign the chasis & print the tunnel(the connection with baseplate took us a lot of time) & redesign electronic placements. Shout out to my roomate, another coleader of our RC club, we spent a lot of time working together in the 6 month span of this project. I enjoyed working with him after light out everyday, liked the feeling of collaboration to make something big. 
This project taught me a lot of stuff, and its not just CADing - its running simulations, the experience of maintaining structure stregnth in designs, collaboration(like keeping a clean work space in CAD, my roomate's modifications tortured me a lot lol)...
