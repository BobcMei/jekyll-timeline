I used to use plates to feed my pet chickens water, but the always contaminate their own drinking water. Therefore I CADed this and printed with TPU, so that the water is supplied from a bottle and the chickens can only access water in 4 separate small spaces(I have 4 chickens), which avoids contamination, also helps making sure they don't fight for water. When desgining I also used some physics and calculated the surface area needed for the small space so that the water won't spill. (basically F_atm in the small space = W_water + F_ atm in the bottle). After the first model is made, I realized that the chickens often knocks over the bottle so I also designed and printed a baseplate to stablize the feeder. It feels great making products that I can use in my everday life by myself.
