A jellyfish shaped ultrasonic sensor lamp, lights up when people pass by. This project helped me to learn CAD & building circuit. The cardboard part were CADed and produced with laser cut. The circuit is made with relay switch, arduino board, UV sensor and a light bulb. I Extracted the wire from the bulb and connected it to the relay switch, which is manipulated by the arduino + ultrasonic sensor. This is the first circuit project I made with high voltage electronics.
